“Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.” — Albus Dumbledore

Kabir is on a journey and he has been for some time. Growing up in a household full of men, conversations regarding mental health were non-existent for him. His family molded him to be a strong, tenacious man that remained stoic during the toughest of times. Kabir understands now, more than ever, that mental health flows hand in hand with physical health, and neither can be disregarded.

On Your Mental is all about breaking that mould and getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. We look forward to grow with all of you, one episode, one conversation at a time.
