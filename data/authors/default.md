I focus on building the best solutions for people, addressing every one of their needs. I find listening goes a long way in understanding just what those needs are. Helping others, both as an individual and with a team, is where I find my happiness in work!

My experience with sales, technical support, and employee development provides a unique perspective in the technology industry and the world of customer service. I am a strong believer in the importance of listening to the needs of others and helping them find their own happiness.
