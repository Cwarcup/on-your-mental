More often than not, men keep things bottled up. We tend not to talk about things that worry us, or things that weigh on our minds, or things we simply care about. Men's mental health can suffer from that. This is where On Your Mental comes in.

Reuben’s grown up in an environment where sharing what was on his mind was encouraged every step of the way. As far as family goes, he’s an only child to a single mom who’s always advocated for openness at home. His friends have had to sit there and listen to him share everything that he thinks about; the ups and the downs of life. Reuben wanted to bring that same feeling that he’s been lucky enough to have all his life, to you.

If you’ve found On Your Mental, we hope that with every episode you feel like you can share more of your life with the people in it.
