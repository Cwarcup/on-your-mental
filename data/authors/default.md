More often than not, men keep things bottled up. We tend not to talk about things that worry us, or things that weigh on our minds, or things we simply care about. Men's mental health can suffer from that. This is where On Your Mental comes in. On this podcast we're changing the way men look at being open with one another.Hosted by Reuben Hardern & Kabir Sandhu. The way we see it, everyone deserves to feel comfortable sharing what's on their minds, and setting an example will help. On Your Mental is ending the stigma around men being vulnerable, one conversation at a time. Learn more about men and what's on their minds with a new episode every week. Video versions also available on YouTube!
